Thank you for taking the time to complete this technical assessment. The test consists of two parts:
 1. A coding exercise
 2. A few technical questions
 Please submit your work as a link to a public GitHub repository for the recruiter to review.
 If you prefer not to make your code public, feel free to reach out so we can arrange an alternative.
 Be sure to include a markdown file with your answers to the technical questions in the same repository.
 1. Coding Exercise
 Create a .NET Core Web API that takes a city name as input and returns the following information:- Temperature (in Celsius)- Humidity (in %)- Wind Speed (in meters per second)- Air Quality Index (AQI)- Major pollutants (e.g., PM2.5, CO, NO , etc.)- Latitude and Longitude
 To accomplish this, please use the following service:
 OpenWeatherMap API
 (Provides weather and air pollution data)
 You will need to sign up and obtain a free API key.
 Project Requirements
 Please implement the following user story:
 As a user running the application,
 I want to input a city name
 So that I can view the current environmental conditions of that city
 Acceptance Criteria:- For a known city like "Tehran", valid information should be returned.- The output should include:- Temperature- Humidity- Wind Speed- Air Quality Index (AQI)- Major pollutants- Geographical coordinates (Latitude/Longitude)
 Additional Notes:- Your code should compile and run in one step.- You may use any libraries or frameworks you prefer.- Code should be clean and follow Clean Code principles.- At least one unit test must be included.
 2. Technical Questions
Please answer the following questions in a file named Answers to technical questions.md:- How much time did you spend on this task?
 If you had more time, what improvements or additions would you make?- What is the most useful feature recently added to your favorite programming language?
 Please include a code snippet to demonstrate how you use it.- How do you identify and diagnose a performance issue in a production environment?
 Have you done this before?- What’s the last technical book you read or technical conference you attended?
 What did you learn from it?- What’s your opinion about this technical test?- Please describe yourself using JSON format.
 Thank you again for your time — we look forward to your response!
